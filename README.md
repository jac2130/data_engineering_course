# Data Engineering for the 21st Century
The idea for this course is to teach data engineering by building substantively interesting and relatable projects, showing off new and cutting edge methods of data engineering.  These new methods make the discipline easier and more delightful while also adding some powers that have recently been made available by a number of open source communities and by Google. This will include sophisticated pipelining using Apache Beam and Tensorflow as well as Google BigQuery. The goal is to go from ingesting data through ETL, ELT and EL, feature engineering at scale (assuming large datasets that don't fit into memory) through model building and deployments to arrive at complete data products.
